Takeaways:
- Looks good
- Checkbox wraps weirdly but that's because there's an unnecessary padding on the right side. We should jut remove that, and then we should be good.
- Padding above chart and image should be a bit increased but that's unrelated to nested columns. Map e.g. has a good top padding.
