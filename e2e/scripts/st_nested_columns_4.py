This is a super complex layout. It requires 2 levels of nesting and I even left out
a few details of the original request. We shouldn't support this!

Takeaways
- Yeah, this is way too complex for a Streamlit app.
- Side note: dataframe doesn't resize if sidebar is collapsed, we should fix that (with use_container_width=True).
- It also looks weird on small screen sizes. Because there are so many columns,
  they naturally become very small. So if you make the window small, they become tiny,
  which makes things look weird. E.g the text in the top left gets stretched out vertically way too much.
  And the images on the right side don't have the same height as the rest of the content any more.
- On mobile it's OK actually since everything is just below each other. The toolbar on the
  left looks weird but OK, can't really change that much.
